## Some logical operators

-   == (does this match?)

-   != (do these not match?)

-   \>,\< \>=, \<= (greater than, less than

-   &, \| (AND, OR (union, intersection))

```{r}
4 == 5

4 == 4

4 != 5

# does 4 the number match "4"? different types

4 == "4"

# with assigned variables

cat <- 10
dog <- 7

cat < dog

# is dog greater than cat, or is cat less than 20/

dog > cat | cat < 20

# is dog less than cat and cat == 10

dog < cat & cat == 10

dog < cat & cat > 2 & 4 >= dog
```

```{r}
names(mtcars)

ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, 
                        y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = wt, 
             size = mpg))
```
